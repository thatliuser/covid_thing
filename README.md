This is a pretty goofy C++ "web application" I made to generate fake COVID symptom surveys,
when I was too lazy to fill them out due to bad WiFi (and health servers).

This isn't runnable without setting up a Google app endpoint, but I don't feel like documenting it.
You should be able to figure out how it works based on what files are missing from `strings/` (in the gitignore).
